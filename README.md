# DNN-based-Face-Detection
> Deep Neural Net based face detection project, detetcting the faces in the images, videos, 
> or using webcam with a greater accuracy, as compared to my previous project on face detection.
> It is based on Single-Shot-Multibox detector and uses ResNet-10 Architecture as backbone. 
> The model was trained using images available from the web, but the source is not disclosed. 
> OpenCV provides 2 models for this face detector:

> 1. Floating point 16 version of the original caffe implementation.
> 2. 8 bit quantized version using Tensorflow.

This is CAFFEMODEL based implementation of the project.

# Pre-requisites:
* OpenCV (version 3.x or higher)
* Caffemodel file, used for detection(provided in the uploaded files)
* Deploy.prototxt file(provided in the uploaded files)

# Installation of OpenCV:
Here I have not used anaconda python distribution for the environment and hence I had to build the OpenCV package from the 
source for the implementation of this project.
